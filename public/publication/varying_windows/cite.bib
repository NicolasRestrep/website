  abstract = {Formative windows have become common in models about cultural evolution, but their length and shape are rarely parameters that are explored. Meanwhile, sociological work about the life-course suggests that there might be cross-cultural variation in the shape of formative periods. In this paper, I build an agent-based simulation that explores this variation. The results suggest that the pace of cultural change depends on the interaction between a group's demographic makeup and the shape of sensitive periods. Formative windows specify when agents learn, and a group's age-structure suggests how many agents find themselves in those periods. Thus, these elements are informative of how quickly groups might change in light of new information, and the extent to which that information might spread.},
