In this paper we argue that the social learning strategies agents use are important for understanding processes of cultural transmission. Even though research on social learning and social networks has increasingly considered different sources of social influence, many models of cultural transmission still tend to assume agents that use only a single social learning strategy. Here, we incorporate current knowledge about social learning into models of cultural transmission and assess its implications. We argue that classic formulations of social influence can be extended to incorporate different social learning heuristics. To illustrate this, we build an agent-based simulation that incorporates the idea that individuals use different social learning strategies simultaneously when deciding their lines of action.  Our model suggests that the weight agents place on different sources of influence affects trajectories of cultural transmission. Moreover, the impact that different combinations of learning strategies have is mediated by network topology. Our model is capable of replicating important findings that we have come to expect from models of cultural transmission such as the idea that sub-populations can emerge even in fully connected structures. Our key contribution is that we present an alternative way of arriving at this finding - by manipulating the weight that agents place on the different sources of social influence.","tags":["Cultural Transmission","Diffusion","Prestige-biased learning","Social learnint","Social influence"],"title":"Cultural Transmission and the Dynamics of Global and Local Social Influence.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Restrepo Ochoa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1650240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650240000,"objectID":"3c60a342cf20623d803d4cb5863e8eda","permalink":"https://restrepo-ochoa.netlify.app/publication/varying_windows/","publishdate":"2022-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/varying_windows/","section":"publication","summary":"Formative windows have become common in models about cultural evolution, but their length and shape are rarely parameters that are explored.

For example, at present, there is widespread debate about how individuals perceive events as immoral. In this paper, I use sociological approaches to cultural meaning to test one of the leading theories of moral cognition: the idea that individuals attribute immorality through template matching. I use spatial measures of cultural meaning to define and locate a prototypical moral wrong. I then test the theory of template matching and find evidence that distance from the typical moral transgression - in semantic space is related to the time it takes to categorize an event as immoral or harmful. I then test these results on a corpus of naturally occurring text to assess their external validity. These studies provide empirical evidence supporting the notion that the attribution of immorality occurs through template matching. Furthermore, they also serve to illustrate that productive conversations can emerge when we take the insights that sociologists of culture and cognition have reached in the past few decades out of their disciplinary boundaries.","tags":["Culture and cognition","Categorization","Morality","Template Matching","Affect Control Theory","Dyadic Theory of Morality"],"title":"Template matching and moral judgment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ketika Garg","Cecilia Padilla-Iglesias","Nicolas Restrepo Ochoa","V.

CPF could have significantly changed hunter‚Äìgatherers‚Äô spatial use and mobility, altered social networks and increased opportunities for information-exchange. We evaluated whether CPF patterns facilitate information-transmission and considered the potential roles of environmental conditions, mobility strategies and population sizes. We built an agent-based model of CPF where agents moved according to a simple optimal foraging rule, and could encounter other agents as they moved across the environment. They either foraged close to their home within a given radius or moved the location of their home to new areas. We analysed the interaction networks arising under different conditions and found that, at intermediate levels of environmental heterogeneity and mobility, CPF increased global and local network efficiencies as well as the rate of contagion-based information-transmission. We also found that central-place mobility strategies can further improve information transmission in larger populations. Our findings suggest that the combination of foraging and movement strategies, as well as the environmental conditions that characterized early human societies, may have been a crucial precursor in our species‚Äô unique capacity to innovate, accumulate and rely on complex culture.","tags":["Social Networks","Movement Ecology","Hunter-Gatherer Mobility"],"title":"Hunter-Gatherer foraging networks promote information transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Specifically, I am interested in the instances that prompt individuals to revisit the habits and beliefs that have served them well in the past. There are many parts to this puzzle: we have to understand what beliefs are and how to measure them; what the relationship between beliefs and behavior is; how cultural beliefs are transmitted; and what kind of social structures allow for the effective transmission and retention of culture. In my work, I try to shed light on these issues.\nMoral Beliefs I am very interested in moral beliefs - ideas about what is right and wrong. I have done work about how we can use the tools of cultural sociology to adjudicate between theories about how we attribute immorality. I am currently collaborating with Daniela Goya-Tochetto and Kurt Gray, developing an instrument that can capture how people perceive the vulnerability of different agents. These differences in perceived vulnerability, we argue, account for some of the variance we see in moral judgment across groups.\n   Social Learning Part of understanding how people change their beliefs and habits is to ask where they find novel information. During grad school, I became familiar with work on social influence, but it was particularly exciting to see that there is a whole line of interdisciplinary work examining how we learn from one another. I - alongside Tom Wolff - use tools from the social learning literature to note that that the learning strategies that agents use combine with network topologies to produce different patterns of cultural diffusion. I am working in building models that are able to detect the prevalence of different learning strategies (e.g. prestige-biased social learning vs. follow-the-majority) in longitudinal relational data. Along with Alberto Acerbi, I am also working on a project that seeks to explore a tension that exists in the social learning literature: if humans are such keen foragers of social information, why do they often underuse such information?\n   Formative Periods Recent work on attitudinal change suggests that adults rarely update their beliefs. After the socialization and exploration that characterizes our formative years, the story of adulthood is one of stability. This finding resonates with interdisciplinary work, which has evidenced these periods of increased malleability across species and contexts. Questions remain, however, about what it is about these periods that leads to attitudinal formation and change. Biological rhythms are part of the explanation, but these formative periods are also quite particular: they are characterized by sustained social learning and punctuated by changes in social contexts. I have tried to explore these questions. In this paper, I try to explore the interaction between the shape of formative periods and the demographic characteristics of a group. I argue that these two factors might combine to produce different patterns of cultural change. In other words, if individuals change with higher chance during a particular life-stage, then large-scale change should - at least partially - be a result of how many agents open to change there are at any point. The size of formative periods, along with the age-structure of a group, define this supply of ‚Äúchangers‚Äù.\nNow, whether the shape of formative periods actually varies across historical and cultural contexts is an empirical question. In a ongoing project with Kevin Kiley, we try to answer this question by looking at longitudinal data for individuals of the same age bands but from different cohorts. Specifically, we are interested in testing the hypothesis of whether young adulthood has extended.\n   Attitudinal Formation and Change An important question is how we are socialized into our beliefs. Who is likely to keep the same moral beliefs as their parents? Who is likely to change? Along with Turgut Keskinturk, we are trying to shed light on these questions. Drawing inspiration from Kevin Kiley‚Äôs work, we conceive of belief spaces as a set of more or less adjacent positions, where individuals can place themselves. These spaces can be thought of as rugged landscapes: certain positions are more stable than others, representing the global optima. We are interested in trajectories of movement across that rugged landscape - who stays around the peak where they start? Who makes what are known as ‚Äúhot transitions‚Äù, traveling between different optima? To answer these questions we are using longitudinal data and computational text analysis.\n   Networks for Cultural Transmission Social scientists have often envisioned cultural transmission occurring through social networks. In my work, I explore the role of networks in the transmission or retention of cultural information. With different colleagues, we recently published a simulation-based paper that shows that central-place foraging results in networks that are well suited for cultural transmission.
