summary: More about my research
title: "My work"
---

I am interested in cultural change. Specifically, I am interested in the instances that prompt individuals to revisit the habits and beliefs that have served them well in the past. Recent work on attitudinal change suggests that adults rarely update their beliefs.  After the socialization and exploration that characterizes our formative years, the story of adulthood is one of stability. This finding resonates with interdisciplinary work, which has evidenced these periods of increased malleability across species and contexts. Questions remain, however, about what it is about these periods that leads to attitudinal formation and change. Biological rhythms are part of the explanation, but these formative periods are also quite particular: they are characterized by sustained social learning and punctuated by changes in social contexts. My research tries to understand the situations that lead us to adopt new beliefs or reexamine the ones we already hold, whether in our formative periods or – under exceptional circumstances – in adulthood.
