abstract: "When learning from one another, individuals use different strategies and heuristics. In this paper we argue that the social learning strategies agents use are important for understanding processes of cultural transmission. Even though research on social learning and social networks has increasingly considered different sources of social influence, many models of cultural transmission still tend to assume agents that use only a single social learning strategy. Here, we incorporate current knowledge about social learning into models of cultural transmission and assess its implications. We argue that classic formulations of social influence can be extended to incorporate different social learning heuristics. To illustrate this, we build an agent-based simulation that incorporates the idea that individuals use different social learning strategies simultaneously when deciding their lines of action.  Our model suggests that the weight agents place on different sources of influence affects trajectories of cultural transmission. Moreover, the impact that different combinations of learning strategies have is mediated by network topology. Our model is capable of replicating important findings that we have come to expect from models of cultural transmission such as the idea that sub-populations can emerge even in fully connected structures. Our key contribution is that we present an alternative way of arriving at this finding - by manipulating the weight that agents place on the different sources of social influence."
