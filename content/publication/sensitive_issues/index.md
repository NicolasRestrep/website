abstract: "Cohort replacement---the replacement of older cohorts by their successors who developed under different conditions---is an important process driving cultural change. Research on public opinion in the United States indicates that most aggregate changes are best understood as the result of cohort replacement, rather than individuals changing their minds.  However, some publicly salient sensitive issues, like gay rights, appear to be exceptions. Why exactly these issues appear to follow different trajectories of change it not well understood. A key reason is that previous work is limited by its focus on a single national context and the lack of a systematic comparison between more and less sensitive issues. We use data from the 1981-2020 World Values Surveys to compare aggregate changes in public opinion in 8 countries. We compare the trajectories of more sensitive and less sensitive issues to see if the pattern observed in the United States is generalizable. We find common trends – like changes in attitudes towards homosexuality – across most countries, as well as context-specific patterns that follow recognizable historical processes. An important insight is that sensitive issues seem to change more through cohort replacement. In short, issues that are difficult to talk about change more privately."
